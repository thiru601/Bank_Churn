# Bank_Churn
Academic Project to predict attributes of customers who would churn in the Financial Industry

Results:
86% accuracy score with Random Forest 
Recommendations: 
1. Increase awareness amongst customers on importance of maintaining a healthy credit score
2. Customized financial advisory and investment offerings to different segments of customers
3. Launch Digital products and diverse schemes to woo customers from different age brackets

Methodology and Reasoning 
The team used KNN, decision trees, and logistic regression on the churn data. 

Random Forest was the best model for predicting customer churn with an accuracy score of 86%. 
Logistic Regression was 79%, KNN was 70%

The reasoning behind each recommendation (respectfully):
1. Credit Score was inversely proportional to Churn Rate
2. Balance was directly proportional to Churn Rate
3. Age was directly proportional to Churn Rate
